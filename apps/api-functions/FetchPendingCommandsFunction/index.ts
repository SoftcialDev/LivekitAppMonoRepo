/**
 * Azure Function handler for fetching pending commands.
 * 
 * This function handles the retrieval of pending commands by:
 * 1. Authenticating the caller using Azure AD token
 * 2. Extracting caller ID and validating employee access
 * 3. Delegating to FetchPendingCommandsApplicationService for business logic
 * 4. Returning the most recent un-acknowledged command or null
 * 
 * @param ctx - Azure Function context
 * @param req - HTTP request
 * @returns Promise that resolves when the pending commands are fetched
 * @throws {UnauthorizedError} when authentication fails
 * @throws {PendingCommandAccessDeniedError} when user lacks permissions
 * @throws {PendingCommandUserNotFoundError} when user is not found or inactive
 * @throws {PendingCommandFetchError} when fetching commands fails
 * 
 * @example
 * GET /api/FetchPendingCommands
 * Response: { "pending": PendingCommand | null }
